In this version, update password will not work, I mean when the user wants to initialize his password, he should receive an email with a link to update it, but I don't want to put my email and my password in the file .env in git, I already put all the api key, and I know that it's a breach security, but I had no choice to make this application functional locally. But in heroku update password work perfectly!
